Tenkai is a 2D game engine written in JavaScript. It is designed to create games that run in the browser using standard PNG/JPG/MP3 assets, supporting multiple nested scenes and entities (sprites/mobs), audio and sfx, and an event driven management system. 

When combined with the [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) project, Tenkai can be used to build standalone games that run on a variety of platforms including Windows, MacOS and Linux. 

## Installation

```
npm install tenkai
```

## Documentation

Tenkai is a set of ES2015 classes designed to be complied to a JS application for the browser using [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or another similar toolchain. A blank game project with an on-demand complier and an [Electron](https://electronjs.org) build toolchain is available.
